:project: Not Alone

= Requirements Specification

== Introduction 

// Ce chapitre décrit les exigences du projet «{project}». Il suit la norme IEEE 830-1998.

=== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the requirement specifications for the project «{project}» for software engineering students.

The intended audience of this specification includes the prospective developers of the tool, as well as the technical assessment personnel.

// Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.

=== Document Conventions

None so far.

// Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.

=== Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions


// Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.

=== Project Scope

// Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

The software system to be produced is a simplified version of the Hearthstone online game, which will be referred to as «{project}» thorough this document.

The {project} system will allow players from different locations to confront each-other in short and intensive games.

// List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

=== Overview 

The rest of this document contains an overall description of the {project} software system (section <<description>>), the specific functional requirements (section <<features>>), and the non-functional requirements for the system (see <<nonfunctional>>.

[#description]
== Overall Description

=== Product Perspective

Hearthstone is a card game where two players confront each-other.
The {project} software should allow players that are connected to the Internet to use their connected devices to play.
Thus, «{project}» is an online, electronic version of the card game.

While the system is distributed and organized in different components, players should perceive it as a single piece of software.
Figure <<deployment>> presents the overall architecture of the software.
Players interact with a Web Client, which uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with (at most) one Game Server. 
Servers use TCP/IP to communicate with a Database Management Server, which stores all software data.

// Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.

=== Product Functions

The {project} software must provide two main functions:

. Game creation: allowing two players to discover each other and start a game.
. Game play: allowing players to actually play {project} until the victory of one of them.

// Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

=== User Classes and Characteristics

// Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

The {project} software has only one class of user: players. 
Players may have different levels: beginners, intermediate, or expert.
However, independently from their level, players should use the same user interface to play against each other.

=== Operating Environment

// Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.

The {project} software should operate on any popular and recent operating system: Linux, Windows, or MacOS.
The Web Client should operate on any recent web browser: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Edge.

=== Design and Implementation Constraints

// Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the  developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).

. The Game Server must be developed in Java (version 1.8), using the https://spring.io[Spring Framework].
. The Client must be developed in TypeScript (version 3.1), using the https://angular.io[Angular Framework].
. All software artifacts must use a building too: Maven or Groovy for Java, npm for TypeScript.
. Dynamic tests must use JUnit (version >= 5.0) and Jasmine (version >= 3.5.0).
. The code must log its main operations using https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J].


=== Verification Constraints

. Test Doubles must be used to test each component independently. 
. Each unit test must describe its intention.

=== User Documentation

// List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help,  and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.

No user documentation is required for the first version of the software.

=== Assumptions and Dependencies

// List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the  requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

None until now.

== External Interface Requirements

=== User Interfaces

// Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

=== Hardware Interfaces

// Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

The software does not interact directly with any hardware device.

=== Software Interfaces}

The client part of the software must operate on web browsers, whereas the server part must interact with a database through the Java Persistence API (JPA).

// Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

=== Communications Interfaces

// Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.

Communications between the client and the game server must use  Websockets.

[#features]
== System Features

// This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.

=== Game initialization

// Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few words.

The {project} software must allow the setup of a game with two players and automatically prepare and distribute cards.

==== Description and Priority

See Chapter <<domain>> (domain analysis) for further details.

// Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).

==== Stimulus/Response Sequences

// List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.

==== Functional Requirements

// Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.

// Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

// % REQ-1:	REQ-2:

=== Game play

The {project} software must allow two players to play against each other until a winer is settled.
See Chapter <<domain>> (domain analysis) for further details.

[#nonfunctional]

=== Performance Requirements}

. The game must be _playable_, meaning that users must have fast feedback for their actions and delays due to  communications/connection problems must be correctly held.
. The Web Client must be able to execute on a personal computer with 4GB of RAM.


// If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

=== Safety Requirements

// Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the product’s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be satisfied.

=== Business Rules

// List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional requirements to enforce the rules.


== Other Requirements

// Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.

=== Appendix A: Glossary

//see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
// Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.

=== Appendix B: Analysis Models
